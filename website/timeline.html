      To gain a broad understanding of events this human experiment can be divided into three phases. These
      phases are not distinct and there is some overlap. These are the phases of recent history and the near future.
      Experiments into artificial human augmentation began as early as the 19th century.
    </h5>

    <h4 class="w3-text-dark-grey text-bold">
      1953 to 1973 - Project MKUltra
    </h4>
    <h5 class="w3-text-dark-grey w3-justify">
      Some knowledge of this project is in the public domain. The MKUltra experiments conducted by the US
      government yielded a great deal of information on how a human being could be modified and manipulated for both
      negative and positive purpose. The scope of the experiments extend far beyond what is commonly known and include
      early research on the use of neural interfaces on animal subjects, at this point being sophisticated enough to
      <a href="doc/C00021825.pdf">remotely control the motor functions of dogs</a>. Officially halted in 1973,
      research in this area of course never stopped. This was the middle of the Cold War. Any world power would feel
      that they could not afford to stop developing such strategically important technologies. It was highly probable
      that Russia and China were researching ways to artificially enhance human beings, and in a world ruled by game
      theory that meant America and her allies would have to do the same.
    </h5>

    <h4 class="w3-text-dark-grey text-bold">
      1970’s to present - Age of the Ultra
    </h4>
    <h5 class="w3-text-dark-grey w3-justify">
      A change of tact was needed; a way to make the experiments more morally acceptable to the people who knew about
      them. Outrage causes people to protest and speak out, and that anger needed to be quelled. So begins the “Age of
      the Ultra”. Ordinary people are selected to receive only positive modifications in an effort to make them super
      human. They are selected from a young age, without their knowledge, and helped throughout their lives to become
      successful. In this way, test subjects are no longer perceived to be victims, instead they are thought of as
      lucky and blessed. Many of those selected do go on to achieve great success reinforcing that belief. Of course
      these experimental technologies are not without risk. Test subjects have suffered from side effects ranging from
      the extreme: death, severe mental health issues, deformities, to the more mild such as developing Asperger
      Syndrome, ADHD, and Bipolar disorder. During this time much experimental data is gathered into real world long
      term use of these technologies. The technologies are further refined and developed into safer, more
      cost-effective forms in preparation for larger scale deployment.
    </h5>
    <h4 class="w3-text-dark-grey text-bold">
      Present to 2050? 2060? 2070? - Mass deployment
    </h4>
    <h5 class="w3-text-dark-grey w3-justify">
      We have been told this phase has already started, though we have no information as to what extent. In this phase
      neural interfaces are slowly deployed to the wider population. This begins when the technology has reached
      sufficient maturity, the infrastructure is in place, and the costs have come down sufficiently for it to become
      economically viable. There are a variety of ways that could be theoretically achieved. At the moment, implants
      are inserted surgically but advances in nanotechnology, which could be available within our lifetimes, will allow
      an even more covert, non-surgical method. It will take decades but the end of this phase would be when the
      majority of the population becomes implanted with a neural interface.<br/><br/>
