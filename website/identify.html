    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Being able to determine if somebody is an Ultra can be difficult. The augmentations are deliberately designed to
      leave little trace, and to the untrained eye an Ultra would appear similar to everyone else. It is only through
      our own experiences that we know what to look for, and we share that now in order that you may be able to help us
      find others. This guide would also be useful in helping you yourself determine if you have been modified in some
      way.
    </h5>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>We are not claiming that every single person who exhibits one the following signs is an Ultra.</h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>It is not possible to identify all Ultras via observation of external clues. Only those which have been
          modified with a treatment that leaves some sign. The neural interface for instance leaves none and only the
          individual implanted with one may be able to tell.</h5>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h1 class="w3-padding-top-16">Personality clues</h1>
    <h5 class="text-bold">
      <a href="ultra.html#InspiringSelfBelief">Extreme self belief</a>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Belief in being 'the chosen one', or having a special purpose is a strong indicator that someone is an Ultra.
      The program designed to increase a persons self belief, requires the deployment of sophisticated psychological
      techniques used over an extended time period to achieve the desired effect. Making someone truly believe that they
      are fated to fulfill a special purpose requires resources typically only expended on those in the Ultra program. These
      people can sometime display extreme levels of arrogance and overconfidence in their ability, leading them to attempt
      things they are completely unqualified for. A musician running for president would be a good example.
    </h5>

    <h5 class="text-bold">
      <a href="ultra.html#EmpathyImpairment">Ruthlessness/Heartlessness/Insensitivity</a>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Extreme acts of selfishness and ruthlessness can indicate that somebody has had their sense of empathy
      artificially impaired. For example, a person purchasing the rights to a drug which was the only treatment for a particular disease, and then increasing its price many times, thus jeopardising lives for profit, would be a behaviour that most 'normal' people would be incapable of.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="text-bold">
      <a href="ultra.html#CognitiveEnhancement">Social awkwardness</a>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Social awkwardness and other symptoms typically ascribed to those suffering from Asperger's Syndrome is a sign
      that a person has undergone the cognitive enhancing therapy. Often having difficulty staying present 'in the
      moment', becoming lost in thought in the middle of a conversation, this sign is rather easy to spot and is often a
      defining characteristic of the Ultra.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="text-bold">
      Mental health issues
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Mental health issues have been reported by a few people we know to be Ultras. Ranging from mild cases to the more
      severe requiring many years of treatment. These can be caused by the treatments themselves or some of the things
      an Ultra would experience as part of the program. These experiences, falling completely outside the realms of what would
      be considered normal human experience, can be difficult to process. Those who become aware of the neural interface
      can also become vulnerable to mental issues, being forced to live a life where your mind is under constant
      surveillance puts you under unnatural stresses.
    </h5>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="w3-padding-top-16">Physical clues</h1>
    <h5 class="text-bold">
      Youthful appearance
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Ultras have been known to look far younger than their actual age. Ageing slower in comparison to siblings and
      cousins, is a good indication that somebody has received some kind of youth restoring treatment.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="text-bold">
      Physical strength
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Ultras have been known to exhibit above average strength for their size. The biological implant which dispenses
      drugs is typically used for delivering steroids resulting in the Ultra developing additional muscle mass.
    </h5>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="w3-padding-top-16">Other clues</h1>
    <h5 class="text-bold">
      Fame and fortune
    </h5>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Ultras are helped for a large portion of their lives to succeed in whatever profession they have chosen. Many do
      then go on to achieve a level of fame and fortune. Sport stars, musicians, business moguls, Ultras are everywhere,
      hiding in plain sight.
