    <h4 class="text-bold">Mass manipulation</h4>
    <h5 class="w3-text-dark-grey w3-justify">
      In recent years, people have begun to understand the problem of data gathered from various sources, being
      amalgamated into centralised database to build up a detailed picture of who they are. That understanding of them,
      then used to deliver highly targeted nudges to prompt them into taking certain actions, primarily the purchase
      of goods and services. The data could easily be put to more nefarious uses, targeting both individuals groups of
      people in a way that causes harm.<br/><br/>
      The neural interface is the endgame of that journey. They say data is the new oil and somebody's thoughts are the
      most valuable form of personal data, allowing you to target them with incredibly accurate nudges and
      manipulations. The neural interface itself can be used to manipulate someone directly by feeding signals into the
      brain, altering somebody's emotional state in a way that could make them more likely, or less likely to take
      certain actions. One of the more disturbing ways we have witnessed this being used was recently, when we first
      decided to go public with this story. One of the Ultras found themselves experiencing panic attacks whenever they
      tried to speak to someone about their experiences, in person or even over the phone. We believe they were induced
      in order to discourage them from speaking out.
    </h5>

    <h4 class="text-bold">Eugenics tool</h4>
    <h5 class="w3-text-dark-grey w3-justify">
      Mass deployment of the neural interface would allow the implementation of sophisticated eugenics policies not
      possible before. A person could now be judged not only by their physical characteristics and intellect, but also
      by the 'quality' of their thoughts i.e. what their religious or political views are. Those deemed less fit or
      those who hold views which do not align with the governing authority could then be subjected to the
      technologically enabled abuses and persecution outlined earlier: Thought policing, sleep deprivation, induced
      panic attacks, dream inception, thought manipulation. The entire population becomes subjugated to a minority who
      control the technology. It becomes impossible to fight back against an abusive power, with the mere thought of
      rebellion bringing one to the attention of the authorities.
    </h5>
    <h4 class="text-bold">Weapon</h4>
    <h5 class="w3-text-dark-grey w3-justify">
      The most worrying scenario is one where control of the technology falls or passes into the hands of persons with
      extreme malevolent intent. When deployed to large percentages of the population the neural interfaces become
      weapons of mass murder, capable of facilitating genocide. It would be naive to think that humanity is no longer
      capable of such evil acts especially considering the ease at which this technology would allow them to be
      carried out. Possibly as simple as pressing a few buttons on a command console, an instantaneous calamity could be
      triggered that leaves little damage to the environment or infrastructure.
