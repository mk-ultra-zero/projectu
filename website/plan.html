        Step 1: Backing up the story
      </h4>
      <h5 class="w3-justify">
        We have made many claims on this website and have provided little proof. We accept that for this story to be taken
        seriously and picked up by major media outlets, we will need hard evidence. There are a few ways that
        may be achieved:
      </h5>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5>
            We need as many Ultras as possible to come forward and speak out about what they have experienced and what
            they believe was done to them. Whilst not all may be even aware, we are certain that some are. Many of these
            people are well known, well respected individuals whose voice would add a huge amount of credibility to our
            campaign. They may also have information we are missing and could help us build up a more complete picture
            of this project.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            We need as many other people with information about the project to do the same and make public what they
            know. Many of theme feel exactly the same way as we do. They see the danger and know how this will play out
            if left to continue. They have done much to help already, passing us a great deal of information. Without
            them our understanding of this project would be a fraction of what it is today. We now need them to help us
            take more direct action.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            You may think that finding the neural implants and other devices would be as easy as having a CT scan or
            X-Ray. Remember this project has been carried out in secret for many decades and an extraordinary effort has
            been expended to ensure it remains hidden. Before implanting somebody with a device, you would have to
            ensure that any scanner that they might across in a medical setting could be configured to hide the presence
            of those devices. This would be an essential step in maintaining secrecy and one we are certain they have
            taken.
            <br/><br/>
            Travelling further afield might be an option, however we have observed a high level of cooperation over this
            project between western countries. Crossing a border or two may not be enough. Someone from Europe, may have
            to travel as far away as China to stand a chance of obtaining a non-manipulated scan.
          </h5>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <h4 class="text-bold">
        Step 2: Spreading the story
      </h4>
      <h5 class="w3-justify">
        Once sufficient evidence is obtained, the immediate next step would be to take the story to major media
        outlets in order to spread awareness to as many people as possible. There are several points that we need to
        ensure are fully understood.
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li><h5>
          The negative effects of neural interface technology for an individual. We have seen the attempts to justify
          their use in Ultras, which is perhaps why people have been less inclined to speak out. We must make it clear
          that unless there is a medical need, the use of this technology in human beings is absolutely unacceptable,
          especially in its current form where a person has no control over the device, and no control over the data
          flowing to and from it.
        </h5></li>
        <li><h5>
          All the consequences of this technology if mass deployment is achieved, including its potential as a weapon
          of mass murder capable of facilitating genocide.
        </h5></li>
        <li><h5>
          The dangers of other technologies used to augment human beings, and how that path will play out in the
          future if countries are allowed to continue developing and deploying these technologies unchecked.
        </h5></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <h4 class="text-bold">
        Step 3: Implementing the systems that will protect us going forward
      </h4>

      <h5 class="w3-justify">
        We must recognise that the technology has been developed, and that cannot be undone. It will pose a threat to
        humanity for as long as we exist. Even if we manage to stop this now, we will require long term safeguards to
        protect us in the future. Laws alone are not enough to protect us, much of the activity which has occurred over
        the last several decades is already illegal.
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li><h5>
          A network of testing centres must be setup so that anyone who suspects they may have been covertly implanted
          with a device can get themselves scanned. The reality we are living in now is one where you could go to
          sleep in a hotel room, at home or in a foreign country, and wake up the next morning implanted with
          something you did not consent to have. You would have not the slightest indication that it is there. The
          capability to do that exists today, and it will only grow more sophisticated in the future. The only way
          I can see to defend against that is to make some kind of testing system available.
        </h5></li>
        <li><h5>
          International treaties must be signed to prevent the further development and proliferation of this technology.
          Today, world powers can justify continued development because they say their rivals are
          doing the same, and they cannot afford to fall behind given the strategic advantages they bestow. The
          only way that justification can be nullified, is if the secrecy around the development of this technology
          ends, and we have a degree of openness and transparency that would give those powers the confidence to stop
          their research. An independent agency must be setup, with similar function to the IAEA, to ensure that any
          further development of these technologies is done safely. It should be within their remit to monitor
          populations to ensure that no country begins to illegally augment their citizens ever again.
        </h5></li>
        <li><h5>
          We must stay awake and stay alert to the multitude of ways they may try and convince us that neural
          interface technology is our future. We must draw a line and let it be never crossed. They may laud its
          benefits and tempt us with its power, promising us that our privacy will be respected. The benefits and
          power may be genuine but if you do not have full control over the neural interface implanted in your body,
          your most fundamental privacy will be gone. This is a fact we must never forget, ensuring that message is
          passed down unadulterated from one generation to the next. We would only need drop our guard for a short
          time for humanity to fall forever into darkness.
