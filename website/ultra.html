    <h1>What is an Ultra?</h1>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">An Ultra is any human being who has been artificially modified with the aim
      of enhancing one or more of their capabilities. The term derives from Project <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">MKUltra</a> in which some of the technologies were
      originally developed. For simplicity, we use this term even though the first Ultras we can identify were born long
      before Project MKUltra began.
    </h5>
    <br/>

    <h1 id="PhysicalMethodsOfEnhancement">Physical methods of enhancement</h1>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">
      Listed here are modifications which involve physically altering somebody. It is by no means complete and likely
      represents just a small number of all the treatments which are in active use. Much of the information presented
      here comes from first-hand experience, the rest has been passed to us anonymously.
    </h5><br/>
    <ul>
      <li id="NeuralInterface">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Neural interface</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">A spherical shaped device implanted within the brain capable of reading brain waves and
          also sending signals back into the nervous system. The power source is a capacitor which recharges itself via
          kinetic movement. There is a wireless transmitter capable of sending and receiving data. It is unclear at this
          time whether the power source and transmitter are located within the brain in the same device or somewhere
          else in the body. It has been suggested possible locations could be behind the sternum or somewhere near one
          of the shoulders. Brain waves are processed remotely for interpretation into image/sound data.<br/><br/>You
          may be wondering how such a device could possibly function as an enhancement. We've spoken about the negatives
          but there are some positives which we suppose are used as the justification for implanting people with these
          interfaces. A key aspect of the current program is helping an Ultra achieve success and being able to
          understand their needs and desires can greatly help in that mission. Wheels can be put in motion to fulfil a
          need as soon as the thought for that need is formed, which could greatly speed up progress towards a goal.
        </h5>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li id="CognitiveEnhancement">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Cognitive enhancement</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">There is a treatment which enhances a persons cognitive ability. How it does this and by
          what mechanism this treatment is delivered we cannot be certain. It is possibly drug based. It possibly
          functions by increasing the number of connections between neurons or increasing the amount of brain tissue.
          What we can be certain of, from experience, are its effects. A person who has been administered with this
          treatment will develop symptoms very similar to Asperger's Syndrome. They find they be able to excel in a
          particular field or skill at the expense of impaired social skills and emotional intelligence. Often
          attracting the ire of others for appearing robotic in nature or saying insensitive things. There are a number
          of successful people who fit that description..</h5>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>
        <h4 class="text-bold">Reflex enhancement</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">There is a treatment which has the effect of improving reflexes and other motor skills such
          as being able to throw a ball accurately at a target. The nature of the treatment is again unknown but could
          be related to the cognitive enhancement. Ultras enhanced with this treatment this would find themselves excelling at
          sports and other physical activities.</h5>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li id="EmpathyImpairment">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Empathy impairment</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">There is an 'enhancement' which impairs a persons sense of empathy. Nature of treatment
          unknown. Ultras given this treatment may find themselves excelling in the business arena where ruthlessness
          is often rewarded. These Ultras can at times attract a great deal of disgust for the sheer lack of concern
          they show for the lives and well-being of others. There are a number of other fields where this trait would be
          useful, some you may find surprising such as in the world of science where one may be willing to research a
          field more thoroughly compared to others who may be held back by moral concerns.</h5>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li id="DrugDeliverySystem">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Slow release drug delivery system</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">There is a biological implant that is capable of releasing drugs into a persons blood
          stream over a long time period. We know of two drugs released by this device: one is a steroid given
          for the purpose of increasing physical strength, the other is an opioid used for the purpose of long term
          pain relief. Possibly to alleviate the pain the implants cause. The device could also be used for other
          pharmaceuticals. This implant is typically placed in a persons thigh.</h5>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>
        <h4 class="text-bold">Genetic modification</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">The CRISPR gene editing technique has been used to directly edit the genome of Ultras. We
          do not know the purposes for which this was done. The ability to edit somebody's genome would have all sorts of
          uses.
        </h5>

    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h1>Psychological methods of enhancement</h1>
    <h5 class="w3-justify">Not all methods used to enhance a person require physical alterations. Some rely on purely
      psychological techniques. These are designed to manipulate a person into taking positive actions which may result
      in them achieving greater successes in life.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li id="InspiringSelfBelief">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Inspiring self belief</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">
          There is a component of the program where the Ultra is inspired to believe in themselves to an extreme degree.
          They are told that they are unique, special, that they are the chosen one and have a purpose that only they
          can fulfill. It is a technique which has been proven to work, instilling a sense of extreme confidence and
          fearlessness which sometimes allows the Ultra to achieve great feats which they perhaps might not have done
          otherwise.
        </h5>
      </li><br/>
      <li id="BigBrother">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Big brother is watching</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">
          Some Ultras are led to believe they are living a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show">Truman
          Show</a> like existence, with all of their actions and activities recorded by a vast array
          of hidden cameras and microphones placed in public and privates spaces. How true
          that is in reality we cannot say but Ultras are given enough compelling evidence to make them believe that it
          is. We suppose the reason for this being that if a person believes they are being watched at all times, then
          they would be compelled to act decently at all times. Much like a person of faith may be compelled to act
          morally if they believed that God was watching and judging their every action.
        </h5>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li id="ThoughtPolicing">
        <h4 class="text-bold">Thought policing</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-justify">
          It is not clear how many Ultras have the neural interface, and how many of those that do, are aware they have
          been implanted with one. For those that are aware, the idea that external observation can improve behaviour
          extends to a persons thoughts as well. Simple knowing that all your thoughts are being read forces you to
          moderate your thinking. If that wasn't bad enough the idea of thought policing has been taken further. There
          have been instances where Ultras have even been made to feel guilty/punished, for simple thinking the wrong
          thing. The stuff of dystopian nightmare I'm sure you will agree and a reality that must be avoided at all
          costs.
